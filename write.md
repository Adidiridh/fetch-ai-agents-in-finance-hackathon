  AI Agents in Finance:- Transforming the Future . In this we can :- 
  . Explore how AI agents are revolutionizing the financial world. From solving
everyday problems to shaping future outcomes.
What are AI and AI-Agents ?
. AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and
perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, understanding language, recognizing
patterns, learning from experience, and making decisions.
 . AI agents are systems designed to autonomously perform tasks or make decisions by perceiving their environment and taking
actions to achieve specific goals. These agents typically operate based on algorithms, learning from data and feedback to improve
their performance over time . 
Types of AI Agents:-
Reactive Agents: Simple rule-based response to the environment.
Model-Based Reflex Agents: Use memory and internal models for decision-making.
Goal-Based Agents: Focus on achieving specific goals.
Utility-Based Agents: Optimize for maximizing utility or satisfaction.
Learning Agents: Learn from experience and adapt over time.
Autonomous Agents: Act independently with minimal human intervention.
Collaborative (Multi-Agent) Systems: Work in groups to achieve shared goals.
Competitive Agents: Compete against other agents or entities.
Deliberative Agents: Use reasoning and planning for decision-making.
Interactive Agents: Engage in conversation and human interaction.
Embedded Agents: Embedded in devices for real-time control and monitoring.
Evolutionary Agents: Evolve their behavior over time through selection and adaptation.
Context-Aware Agents: Make decisions based on the current context or environment.
The AI Agents which I used for personal purposes:-
User Agent:- The user agent periodically sends a list of questions and website url to a RAG agent and logs the received answers.
Key Concepts:
Communicating with other agents.
Used for AI-powered threat detection and monitoring.
Blank Agent:- This agent is used for modifying personal errors and assignments, developing images
AI Agent:- This AI agent receives questions from another agent, queries OpenAI's agents and re.sponds with an answer. Feel free
to modify and experiment with different models or response formats! Just need to provide our own OPENAI api key.
Key concepts:
Handling incoming questions with on_message,
Querying an external LLM (GPT-4o-mini), Sending structured responses.
The AI Agents which I used for other purposes:-
RAG Agent:- The RAG Agent processes user queries with a given website URL, retrieves relevant content and generates
responses using OpenAI's model, also used for healthcare and education problems, finance and cyber security.
Key ConceptsReturns structured answers
It uses GPT-4o-mini for contextual responses
ETH Sender and Processor Agent:- It sends a transaction request and processes the response. It is also used for identifying
blockchain trust score.
Key Concepts:
It sends an ETH transaction request on startup.
It listens for and logs transaction responses.
It starts the receiving agent first to handle the transaction request. Modify as needed for different interactions.
BOB Agent :- The BOB agent on startup sends a question to an AI agent and logs the received answer.
Key concepts:
Sending messages at startup
Communicating with another agent
Handling incoming responses with on_message
Start the AI agent first to ensure it is ready to receive messages. Feel free to modify and experiment with different
questions or interactions.
